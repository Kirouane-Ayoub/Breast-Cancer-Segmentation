The aim of the system is to assist doctors in detecting breast cancer in medical images accurately and efficiently.

The U-Net architecture is a type of convolutional neural network that is widely used for image segmentation tasks.

The system was trained on a large dataset of breast cancer images to learn the features of cancerous and non-cancerous cells. 
It then uses this knowledge to segment and classify the cells in new medical images as cancerous or non-cancerous.
 
The performance of the system was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall, and the results were compared to those of other state-of-the-art methods.

Overall, this project has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of breast cancer diagnosis and treatment, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.
